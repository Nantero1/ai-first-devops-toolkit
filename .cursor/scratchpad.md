*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

Current Task: Implement 100% Schema Enforcement in llm_runner.py
Understanding: Replace basic JSON mode with Semantic Kernel's KernelBaseModel for token-level constraint enforcement
Questions: 
1. âœ… Which Semantic Kernel approach to use? â†’ KernelBaseModel with response_format
2. âœ… How to maintain backward compatibility? â†’ Not needed, we just need to make sure INPUT and OUTPUT is JSON, we want to pass JSONs as input, one has to find a way to covnert these jsons to schema definitoon. use it with the libraries. pydantic has it by default buil-in
3. âœ… Schema loading approach? â†’ Dynamic Pydantic model creation from JSON schema!

Confidence: 100% (Implementation complete and tested successfully)

Next Steps:
â€¢ âœ… Add KernelBaseModel import and dynamic model creation
â€¢ âœ… Update schema loading to support Pydantic models  
â€¢ âœ… Modify execution logic for proper structured output enforcement
â€¢ âœ… Test with existing JSON schemas - WORKING PERFECTLY
â€¢ âœ… Maintain backward compatibility for text-only outputs

Tasks:
[ID-001] Import KernelBaseModel and add dynamic Pydantic model creation
Status: [X] Priority: High
Dependencies: None
Progress Notes: âœ… Completed - Added create_dynamic_model_from_schema() and _convert_json_schema_field()

[ID-002] Update load_json_schema to create Pydantic models
Status: [X] Priority: High  
Dependencies: [ID-001]
Progress Notes: âœ… Completed - Function now returns Type[KernelBaseModel] instead of string

[ID-003] Modify execute_llm_task for structured output enforcement
Status: [X] Priority: High
Dependencies: [ID-001, ID-002]
Progress Notes: âœ… Completed - Uses settings.response_format = schema_model for 100% enforcement

[ID-004] Test with existing schemas and validate 100% enforcement
Status: [X] Priority: Medium
Dependencies: [ID-001, ID-002, ID-003]
Progress Notes: âœ… VALIDATED - Perfect schema compliance with sentiment analysis test

## ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESSFUL
- âœ… 100% schema enforcement active via token-level constraints
- âœ… Dynamic Pydantic model creation from JSON schemas
- âœ… Perfect compliance: sentiment enum, confidence range, array limits, string length
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained for text-only outputs
- âœ… Ready for production CI/CD usage
