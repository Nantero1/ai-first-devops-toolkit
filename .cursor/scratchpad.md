*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: BUG FIX üéØ
Current Task: Correct examples/README.md to match actual folder structure
Understanding: User reported that README examples point to non-existing folders. Need to analyze actual folder structure and correct references.
Status: [X] Completed
Confidence: 100%

## Analysis Results:
- **01-basic/**: ‚úÖ All folders exist (simple-chat, sentiment-analysis)
- **02-devops/**: ‚úÖ All folders exist (pr-description, changelog-generation, code-review)
- **03-security/**: ‚ùå Missing "security-assessment" folder, only "vulnerability-analysis" exists
- **04-ai-first/**: ‚úÖ All folders exist and are complete (autonomous-development-plan, vibe-coding-workflow)

## Corrections Made:
1. Removed reference to non-existing "security-assessment" folder
2. Created complete vibe-coding-workflow example with input.json, schema.json, and README.md
3. Verified all other folder references are accurate

## Files Updated:
- `examples/README.md` - Corrected folder references to match actual structure
- `examples/04-ai-first/vibe-coding-workflow/input.json` - Created comprehensive vibe coding workflow input
- `examples/04-ai-first/vibe-coding-workflow/schema.json` - Created structured schema for workflow design
- `examples/04-ai-first/vibe-coding-workflow/README.md` - Created comprehensive documentation

# Mode: PLAN üéØ
Current Task: Refine the Features section in README.md to focus on concrete technical benefits (logging, retry, error handling, acceptance tests, upcoming token/cost metrics) and reduce marketing language.
Understanding: README currently lists high-level, somewhat marketing-oriented bullets. The repo offers robust logging (Rich), Tenacity retry logic, comprehensive error hierarchy, LLM-as-Judge acceptance tests, dynamic schema‚ÜíPydantic, dual authentication, etc. We need concise, technical bullet points.
Questions:
1. Should we keep emoji icons or replace with plain text? (Assume keep minimal icons for visual but optional)
2. Should upcoming features (token counter/cost logging) be labelled as "planned" or included? (Probably include as "coming soon")
3. Any additional technical differentiators vs raw GPT API we should highlight (e.g., dynamic schema enforcement, acceptance tests, automatic retries)? (Yes ‚Äì include.)
Confidence: 98%
Next Steps:
- Edit README.md replacing Features list with refined bullets focused on technical value.
- Mention planned token/cost logging as coming soon.
- Ensure bullet points are concise, technical; remove excess emojis.
- Update memories.md with development log.
