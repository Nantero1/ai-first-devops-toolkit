*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: AGENT âš¡
Current Task: Create comprehensive unit testing infrastructure with mocked LLM responses
Understanding: Transform validation script into proper unit tests, test all examples, create realistic mocks based on actual LLM responses

## Analysis Complete
**Main Functions to Test:**
- `create_dynamic_model_from_schema()` - Pydantic model creation from JSON schemas
- `_convert_json_schema_field()` - JSON schema field conversion
- `setup_logging()` - Rich logging setup
- `parse_arguments()` - CLI argument parsing
- `load_input_json()` - Input JSON validation
- `create_chat_history()` - Semantic Kernel ChatHistory creation
- `setup_azure_service()` - Azure OpenAI service setup
- `load_json_schema()` - JSON schema loading
- `execute_llm_task()` - Main LLM execution (needs mocking)
- `write_output_file()` - Output file writing
- `main()` - Main orchestration

**Examples to Test:**
- simple-example.json (basic conversation)
- pr-review-example.json (PR review with diff)
- structured-output-example.json (schema validation)
- minimal-example.json (minimal input)
- code_review_schema.json (complex schema)

**Current test_runner.py**: Basic validation tests, not proper unit tests, no mocking

## âœ… Questions Answered:
1. **Test Structure**: Move test_runner.py to separate directory as acceptance test with LLM-as-judge (env vars required)
2. **Directory Structure**: tests/unit/ and tests/integration/
3. **Mock Data**: Localized python fixtures in test files or individual tests (no reuse expected)
4. **LLM Response Realism**: Structural compliance, run actual command to see real responses, research Semantic Kernel mocking
5. **Error Testing**: Most important error paths (auth, network, invalid JSON, malformed input)
6. **Schema Testing**: User refactored function, now uses library (more reliable)
7. **CLI vs Function**: Both approaches for different test categories

## ðŸŽ¯ Additional Requirements:
- Add tenacity exponential retry with jitter decorator to API request function
- Research Semantic Kernel mocking best practices for `await service.get_chat_message_contents`
- Create LLM-as-judge acceptance test explaining env var requirements

Confidence: 95% (all questions answered, clear implementation path)
Next Steps: 
1. Add tenacity retry decorator to API request function
2. Create tests/ directory structure (tests/unit/, tests/integration/)
3. Move test_runner.py to acceptance/ directory with LLM-as-judge pattern
4. Research Semantic Kernel mocking patterns
5. Generate realistic mock responses from actual API calls
6. Implement unit tests with Given-When-Then pattern
7. Implement integration tests for all examples
8. Test CLI interface separately
