*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (🎯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (⚡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → 95% confidence → Agent mode (⚡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → Chain of thought analysis → Agent mode (⚡)

# Mode: PLAN 🎯
Current Task: Fix integration test failures after migration to modular structure
Understanding: 10 integration tests are failing because mock paths haven't been updated for modular structure. Tests are trying to patch old single-file paths but services are now in separate modules.

## Root Cause Analysis ✅
**Issue**: Integration tests are patching incorrect module paths after modularization
- **Current patch**: `"llm_ci_runner.setup_azure_service"` (single-file path)
- **Correct patch**: `"llm_ci_runner.core.setup_azure_service"` (modular path)
- **Reason**: `core.py` imports `setup_azure_service` from `azure_service` module
- **Impact**: Mock isn't applied, real Azure service called → AuthenticationError → SystemExit: 1

## Test Failure Pattern Analysis:
1. **9 tests failing with SystemExit: 1**: Authentication error because mock not applied
2. **1 test not raising SystemExit**: Mock path issue causing different behavior  
3. **Similar to unit test fixes**: Need to update import paths from single-file to modular

## Confirmed Fix Strategy:
**Replace vs Fix Approach** - Update mock paths systematically:
1. Update `test_examples_integration.py` mock paths: `llm_ci_runner.setup_azure_service` → `llm_ci_runner.core.setup_azure_service`
2. Update `test_main_function.py` mock paths (same pattern)
3. Verify all integration mock fixtures use correct modular paths
4. Test incremental fixes to ensure pattern works

## Questions:
1. ✅ Are the integration tests using old import paths? **YES - using single-file paths**
2. ✅ Are they calling functions that have changed module locations? **YES - setup_azure_service**
3. ✅ Are there mock path issues similar to unit tests? **YES - exact same pattern**
4. ✅ Are there missing imports or incorrect API usage? **NO - API usage is correct**
5. ✅ Do tests need new modular entry points? **NO - just mock path updates**

Confidence: 95% (exact same pattern as unit test fixes, clear solution identified)

Next Steps:
- [X] Examine failing integration test files ✅
- [X] Identify SystemExit causes and mock issues ✅  
- [X] Compare with working unit test patterns ✅
- [X] Confirmed systematic fix approach ✅
- [ ] Apply mock path fixes to test_examples_integration.py
- [ ] Apply mock path fixes to test_main_function.py  
- [ ] Test incremental fixes
- [ ] Verify all 10 tests pass
