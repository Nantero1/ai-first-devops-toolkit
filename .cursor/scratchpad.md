*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

## Current Task: Fix Integration Tests - Implementation Phase

### Understanding
Integration tests are designed to test the full pipeline with real file operations and JSON parsing, but mocked LLM service calls. They're currently failing due to several critical issues that need systematic resolution.

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Primary Issue - Mock Return Value Mismatch
- **Problem:** `setup_azure_service()` returns `tuple[AzureChatCompletion, DefaultAzureCredential | None]`
- **Current Test Mock:** Returns just `integration_mock_azure_service` (single value)
- **Error:** `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`
- **Impact:** All integration tests fail at authentication stage

#### 2. Missing Example Files
- **Problem:** Tests reference files like `examples/simple-example.json`, `examples/pr-review-example.json`
- **Reality:** Examples are organized in subdirectories: `01-basic/`, `02-devops/`, `03-security/`, `04-ai-first/`, `05-templates/`
- **Impact:** FileNotFoundError in all tests

#### 3. CLI Interface Test Issues
- **Problem:** CLI tests expect specific error messages that don't match actual behavior
- **Examples:** Tests expect "required" in stderr but get different error types
- **Impact:** CLI tests fail with assertion errors

### Current State Analysis

#### Example Files Structure âœ…
- Well-organized in subdirectories with proper structure
- Each example has `input.json`, `schema.json` (when applicable), `README.md`
- Examples are realistic and comprehensive

#### Mock Response Library âœ…
- `tests/mock_factory.py` provides realistic mock responses based on actual API responses
- Has functions: `create_structured_output_mock()`, `create_text_output_mock()`, `create_pr_review_mock()`, etc.
- Mock responses are based on real API responses captured during testing

#### Integration Test Purpose
- **End-to-end pipeline testing** with real file I/O and JSON processing
- **CLI interface validation** through subprocess calls
- **Schema enforcement testing** with real Pydantic models
- **Template rendering integration** testing
- **Error handling validation** across the full stack

### Questions Resolved âœ…
1. **Mock Return Value:** Need to fix tests to return `(mock_service, None)` tuple
2. **Example Files:** Should copy relevant examples to `tests/integration/data/` for integration testing
3. **Response Library:** `tests/mock_factory.py` already provides realistic responses based on actual API calls
4. **Test Scope:** Integration tests should test real code with only API calls mocked

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Data Setup [IN PROGRESS]
- [X] Create `tests/integration/data/` directory
- [ ] Copy relevant example files from `examples/` subdirectories
- [ ] Organize by test type (simple-chat, code-review, sentiment-analysis, etc.)
- [ ] Create mapping from old test paths to new data paths

#### Phase 2: Mock Fixes
- [ ] Fix `setup_azure_service()` mock return values in all integration tests
- [ ] Update all tests to return `(mock_service, None)` tuple
- [ ] Ensure proper tuple unpacking in main function
- [ ] Test mock fixes with single test case

#### Phase 3: Path Updates
- [ ] Update all file path references in tests
- [ ] Change from `examples/simple-example.json` to `tests/integration/data/simple-chat/input.json`
- [ ] Update schema file paths accordingly
- [ ] Update CLI test file references

#### Phase 4: Response Enhancement
- [ ] Add more comprehensive mock responses to `mock_factory.py`
- [ ] Create structured responses that match schemas
- [ ] Add responses for all example types
- [ ] Ensure responses are realistic and comprehensive

#### Phase 5: CLI Test Fixes
- [ ] Update CLI test error message expectations
- [ ] Fix subprocess test assertions
- [ ] Update authentication error expectations
- [ ] Test CLI interface with proper error handling

#### Phase 6: Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Run all integration tests
- [ ] Ensure proper coverage and assertions
- [ ] Update test documentation
- [ ] Verify Given-When-Then pattern compliance

### Confidence: 98%
All issues are clear and solutions are straightforward. The mock factory already provides realistic responses, and the example structure is well-organized.

### Status: Active Implementation
**Last Updated:** Version 1.1 - Agent Mode activated, Phase 1 in progress
