*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Current Task: Implement structured output schema enforcement for llm_runner.py

**NEW RESEARCH COMPLETE**: Schema enforcement with Microsoft Semantic Kernel and Pydantic models

## Schema Enforcement Implementation Plan

### Understanding:
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel supports structured outputs with Pydantic models
- Two approaches: Direct Pydantic model usage vs JSON schema strings
- Schema can be serialized/deserialized for CI/CD file storage
- Semantic Kernel automatically generates JSON schema from Pydantic models

### Implementation Strategy:

#### 1. Direct Pydantic Model Approach (Recommended)
```python
# In execution settings
req_settings.response_format = MyPydanticModel
```

#### 2. JSON Schema File Approach (CI/CD Friendly)
```python
# Load schema from external file
ChatResponseFormat.CreateJsonSchemaFormat(
    jsonSchemaFormatName="my_schema",
    jsonSchema=BinaryData.FromString(schema_json),
    jsonSchemaIsStrict=True
)
```

### Key Implementation Points:
- âœ… Pydantic models with Field descriptions and examples
- âœ… Schema serialization to JSON for external storage
- âœ… Dynamic schema loading from --schema-file parameter
- âœ… Validation and error handling
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline integration

### Next Steps:
1. Create example Pydantic models with comprehensive Field definitions
2. Implement schema serialization/deserialization functions
3. Update llm_runner.py to support both approaches
4. Create example schema files for common use cases
5. Update documentation with schema enforcement examples

**Status**: Research complete, ready for implementation

Progress:
- [âœ…] Research Microsoft Semantic Kernel structured output capabilities
- [âœ…] Research Pydantic model serialization/deserialization
- [âœ…] Understand CI/CD integration requirements
- [ ] Implement schema enforcement in llm_runner.py
- [ ] Create example schema files
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Test with various schema types
