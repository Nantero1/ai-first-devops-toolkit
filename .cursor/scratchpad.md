*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

# Mode: AGENT âš¡

Current Task: Implement llm_runner.py LLM utilities toolkit

Implementation Status: 
- **Phase**: Implementation of llm_runner.py core script
- **Confidence**: 95% (All requirements clarified, research complete)
- **Mode**: AGENT MODE ACTIVATED - Building solution

Active Implementation:
- âœ… Create llm_runner.py with core functionality (552 lines)
- âœ… Implement JSON input parsing (whole object format)
- âœ… Setup Azure authentication with DefaultAzureCredential
- âœ… Integrate Rich logging with configurable levels
- âœ… Add structured output support with Pydantic
- âœ… Implement error handling with stderr logging
- âœ… Create CLI interface with argparse
- âœ… Migrate to UV with pyproject.toml (removed requirements.txt)
- âœ… Configure UV for system Python usage
- âœ… Add script entry points and development dependencies
- âœ… Update all documentation for UV usage
- âœ… Update test_runner.py for UV compatibility

Progress:
- [âœ…] Core script structure
- [âœ…] Logging setup with Rich
- [âœ…] CLI argument parsing
- [âœ…] JSON input processing
- [âœ…] Azure authentication
- [âœ…] ChatHistory creation
- [âœ…] Kernel execution with structured output
- [âœ…] Output file writing
- [âœ…] Error handling and validation
- [âœ…] Dependencies and setup
- [âœ…] Example files and documentation
- [âœ…] Test validation script
- [âœ…] UV migration and configuration

Status: **PROJECT COMPLETE + UV MIGRATION** ðŸŽ‰

Deliverables:
1. âœ… llm_runner.py - Main script (552 lines)
2. âœ… pyproject.toml - UV configuration with system Python
3. âœ… README.md - Updated for UV usage
4. âœ… examples/simple-example.json - Basic usage
5. âœ… examples/pr-review-example.json - Complex PR review
6. âœ… examples/minimal-example.json - Minimal input
7. âœ… test_runner.py - Updated for UV validation

Ready for deployment with `uv run` in CI/CD pipelines.
