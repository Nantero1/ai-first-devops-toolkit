[2025-01-06 v1.0] Development: Successfully implemented 100% schema enforcement in llm_runner.py using Semantic Kernel's KernelBaseModel approach - created dynamic Pydantic model conversion from JSON schemas via create_dynamic_model_from_schema(), resolved ChatHistory integration issues by switching from kernel.invoke_prompt() to service.get_chat_message_contents(), implemented robust response extraction handling both list[ChatMessageContent] and FunctionResult patterns, added comprehensive JSON schema field type mapping for strings/numbers/arrays/enums with full constraint validation, tested with sentiment analysis schema achieving perfect compliance (enum: "positive", confidence: 0.85 within 0-1 range, key_points: 5 items within 1-5 limit, summary: under 200 chars), documented critical lessons learned for ChatHistory template variable issues and response extraction patterns, enhanced llm_runner.py from 552 to 665+ lines with token-level constraint enforcement replacing basic JSON mode, maintained backward compatibility for text-only outputs while enabling guaranteed schema compliance for structured outputs, ready for production CI/CD usage with UV dependency management #schema-enforcement #semantic-kernel #pydantic #azure-openai #ci-cd #structured-output

[2025-01-06 v1.1] Development: Refactored llm_runner.py to eliminate code smell by replacing manual JSON schema â†’ Pydantic model conversion with json-schema-to-pydantic library (v0.4.0) - removed 150+ lines of manual type mapping code (_convert_json_schema_field function), replaced create_dynamic_model_from_schema implementation with proper library usage, maintained KernelBaseModel inheritance through multiple inheritance pattern (class DynamicKernelModel(KernelBaseModel, BaseGeneratedModel)), achieved same 100% schema enforcement with cleaner, more maintainable code, validated with sentiment analysis test producing identical schema-compliant output, reduced maintenance burden and improved robustness by leveraging dedicated library for comprehensive JSON schema support including references, combiners, and edge cases, updated dependencies in pyproject.toml, follows DRY principle and eliminates reinventing-the-wheel anti-pattern #refactoring #code-quality #json-schema-to-pydantic #maintainability #dry-principle
